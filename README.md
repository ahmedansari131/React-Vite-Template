Welcome to the React project template built using Vite and configured with Tailwind CSS. This template provides a solid foundation for kickstarting your React projects with modern tooling and styling capabilities.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash

    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change directory to the cloned repository:

    ```bash
    cd React-Vite-Template
    ```

3. **Run the Python Script**: Before starting with the React project, run the `main.py` Python script to set up your project. This script allows you to customize the project name:

    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the development server and open your default web browser to preview the project.
